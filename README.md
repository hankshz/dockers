# Docker images

A collection of tools I ever tried.

  - They are properly configured as docker images so it can be easilly re-setup.
  - It is also easier to try clusters in a single machine with docker instance.
  - Finally, it just helps me remember what I have learned.
  - Note: This is not a desired reference for docker configuration but to create a working development environment. Therefore, I moved most related steps into scripts instead of Dockerfile, even if I could, and kept all the builds.
